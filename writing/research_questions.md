# Five Research Questions

## Question 1

* Explain What is the research question?

What department has produced the most __red__ parts.

* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?

We will need access to the data on the part failures, jobIDs, and department IDs in relation to the job. We could even go as far as identify the employee ID responsible for the most failures.

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

This will allow for us to identify where the failures are coming from in order to see if there are consistencies between where the failures are origininating from. We then can provide insights into the pattern behavior of the departments.

## Question 2

* Explain What is the research question?

What are the costs involved with the nonconformances.

* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?

For this data, we will need the information on the costs of the parts along with the nonconformance info. 

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

This will allow for us to see the trends in the job costs that are incurred with a non-conrmance part.

## Question 3

* Explain What is the research question?

What are is the correlation between a __red__ result and the defect code.

* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?

For this question we will need information on the defect codes, defects, and job ID.

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

Once we identify the most common failure, we will be could provide insights into the types of failures experienced to identify potential problems with machines/techniques/etc.

## Question 4

* Explain What is the research question?

What factors influence fault rates in the manufacturing process, and how can these factors be optimized to reduce waste and improve efficiency?

The research questions aim to investigate various aspects related to workcenters, setup operations, fault frequencies, and defect code distribution to identify areas for improvement in the manufacturing process. Specifically:

4a ->Which Workcenters were Involved in Faulty Productions?

4b ->What is the fault frequency in quick setup operations compared to longer setup operations?

4c ->How does the frequency of 'RED' nonconformance incidents vary with different estimated setup hours in job operations?

4d ->What is the distribution of nonconformance incidents across various defect codes in the production process?"
    
* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?
  
To answer these questions, the necessary data includes information on workcenter involvement in production, setup times for job operations, fault frequencies (especially 'RED' nonconformance incidents), and data on defect codes and their distribution in the production process.

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

4a. Workcenter Analysis: Which workcenters are consistently involved in the production of faulty parts? This question helps identify specific workcenters that may require process improvements to reduce fault rates and minimize waste.

4b. Setup Operations Efficiency: What is the fault frequency in quick setup operations compared to longer setup operations? Analyzing fault frequencies based on setup times allows the company to optimize setup processes for efficiency and waste reduction.

4c. Setup Hours Impact: How does the frequency of 'RED' nonconformance incidents vary with different estimated setup hours in job operations? This inquiry examines the relationship between setup duration and nonconformance incidents, aiding in the optimization of setup times to reduce waste.

4d. Defect Code Distribution: What is the distribution of nonconformance incidents across various defect codes in the production process? Understanding which defect codes are most common helps in targeting quality control measures and reducing waste associated with specific defects.

The question helps in Waste Reduction and Trend Identification: These questions are directly related to reducing waste by identifying factors contributing to faulty productions and inefficiencies in the manufacturing process. By addressing these factors, the company can minimize waste, improve product quality, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

## Question 5

* Explain What is the research question?

What aspects of nonconformance issues, including their identification, resolution times, and workcenter frequencies, can be analyzed to improve operational efficiency and minimize waste in the manufacturing process?

5a-> Can we identify nonconformance issues that were addressed and closed within the specific timeframe of the first half of 2023?

5b -> How frequently do nonconformance issues occur in different workcenters?

5c -> What is the average duration it takes for nonconformance issues to be resolved in job operations, and how does this duration vary across different job operations?

5d -> What is the duration between the scheduled start date of job operations and the date they were closed for nonconformance issues, and how does this duration vary across different job operations?


* Speculate on the type of data that would be necessary to answer this question?

To answer these questions, the necessary data includes information on nonconformance issue identification and resolution dates, workcenter frequencies, and job operation details such as scheduled start dates.

* How does this question relate to wasted materials, or the identification of some trend in the data in some way?

5a. Timely Issue Resolution: Can we identify nonconformance issues that were addressed and closed within the specific timeframe of the first half of 2023? This question helps in assessing the company's ability to promptly resolve quality issues and reduce waste.

5b. Workcenter Analysis: How frequently do nonconformance issues occur in different workcenters? Analyzing nonconformance occurrences by workcenter helps pinpoint areas with higher quality or operational challenges, which can contribute to waste reduction.

5c. Resolution Time Variation: What is the average duration it takes for nonconformance issues to be resolved in job operations, and how does this duration vary across different job operations? This inquiry examines the efficiency of issue resolution and highlights areas where improvements can reduce waste.

5d. Scheduled Start vs. Closure: What is the duration between the scheduled start date of job operations and the date they were closed for nonconformance issues, and how does this duration vary across different job operations? Analyzing the time between scheduled start and closure provides insights into operational efficiency and potential waste reduction opportunities.

These questions are directly related to minimizing waste by identifying inefficiencies in issue resolution, understanding workcenter-specific challenges, and optimizing operational timelines. Addressing these aspects can lead to waste reduction and improved overall operational efficiency.
